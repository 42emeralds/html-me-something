                    <p>For me camping was an integral part of my childhood. I spent many summers packed in a five person tent with my family, cooking, cleaning, hiking, and exploring the Ozarks. My husband Austin however, hadn't been camping until he met me and even then we had only gone on weekend excursions. We decided it was time for us to take in all that this expansive country had to offer and take a month long road trip across the northern part of the western United States. We started from St. Louis, MO and from there drove 5,000 miles, hitting the Pacific Ocean and looping back around to Springfield, MO. We packed up my Elantra with everything we (thought) would need to live outside for the next month and set off on our first real camping trip together.</p>

                    <p>Me and my husband started our 5,000 mile, 28 day trip around the northwestern half of the U.S. in Badlands National Park. We had visited the Badlands with family a couple years prior, and were enchanted by the alien landscape nestled within the seemingly endless grassy hills of South Dakota. We pulled up to our campsite right as the sun was setting, and threw up our tent in the shadow of the stratum mounds. The most memorable thing about that night was the silence, and how it allowed the sounds of all the wolves howling to carry on the wind. </p>

                    <p>Driving towards Devils Tower, I exclaimed out loud "we should be able to see it any minuteâ€¦" right as we came around a hill and saw the incredible formation (known as Mato Tiplia to the Lakota tribe) rising starkly against the flat horizon. I didn't have many expectations for this park, and was blown away by what it had to offer. Between the amazing campsite we scored with a direct view of the tower out of our tent, the prairie dog village that bordered the campground,  and the perfect starter trail for our trip starting at our campsite I was pleasantly surprised by this stop.</p>

                    <p>Out of all of the stops on our trip, Yellowstone National Park may have been the most challenging. I have camped my entire life but it's usually been in the summer and mostly in the southern midwest, Yellowstone was an entirely different playing field. We set our tent up in the rain, and five (wet) days later we took it down in the rain. It made us realize how important shelter really was, when you're living exclusively outside. The only 'indoors' we had was a very small two person tent, and that wasn't really somewhere that we could utilize to cook our meals or spend our downtime. The park itself turned out to be a mental challenge for me as well. While it was astoundingly gorgeous, and unlike anything I've ever seen, it was also very structured. Since it's built on hydrothermal systems, there are very strict paved paths and boardwalks which made me feel like I wasn't doing my 'grand outdoor adventure' right. I wanted to be out in the woods, struggling through the mud and walking on asphalt made me feel like I was just a tourist overdressed in my hiking boots. After stepping away from Old Faithful, and exploring the other hydrothermal pools  my guilt started to lessen and I learned a valuable lesson in setting expectations for myself.</p>

                    <p>We drove a short way down from Yellowstone to stay in the fringes of Grand Teton National Park. The adolescent mountain range was covered in clouds as we drove in, masking the peaks and looking back I think that was the perfect way to come into it. As the day went on the clouds retreated like someone pulling back the curtain and the mountains colossal nature was revealed almost suddenly. On our hike around Jenny lake, I kept catching myself thinking "how is this real?" Every turn felt like it brought some new, previously unimaginable landscape.</p>

                    <p>Idaho may have been the biggest surprise for us since I had never heard much praise for it. Turns out it's filled with mountains and forests, streams and natural hot springs. We stayed at the base of the Sawtooth Mountain range, in a small campground obviously filled with locals. The 'backwoods' nature of some of these individual may have scared some people off, but I was raised in southern Missouri so it was nothing new for me. One of my biggest goals on this trip was to soak in a natural hot spring, and Idaho is full of them! We set off down the highway in search of a small manmade reservoir of hot spring water cupped within the river, creating a Goldilocks mix that was tolerable for humans. After driving back and forth, we finally found the small rock pool and spent our afternoon stewing in the magma warmed waters.</p>

                    <p>After sleeping outside for almost two weeks, we had factored in a 'city day' so we could sleep indoors and reset ourselves. Normally I love cities, I've always loved skylines (especially at night) and the bustle of people around me. Driving into Portland however, I realized that spending extended time out in nature had shifted my love of cities a little. I now found the concrete and urban decay more confining. A little disheartened, we stopped at a vegan barbeque joint called Homegrown Smoker and ate ourselves happy. One thing I will say for Portland is they know vegan food. Every meal we had topped the last and we must have eaten the equivalent of our body weight in the two days we were there. For a little recoup, we spent the afternoon at a resort that was built in an old elementary school, and lounged in their outdoor soaking pool with our coffee. A break from the tent was much welcomed,  but by the end of our stay I was ready to get back into the woods.</p>

                    <p>The first tears of the trip came in the redwoods. Driving into the Redwoods felt like driving back in time. The trees became larger, dwarfing us in what felt now like a toy car. The fog became thicker and almost milky, ferns started covering the forest floor and the highway became more shed needles than asphalt. Not only was dusk settling in, but the thick canopy muted what remaining light there was and we were quickly plunged into eerie darkness. The entrance to our campground was lit by a single orange light, and the feeling of unease started the moment I turned onto the drive. We started our descent, plunging even deeper into prehistoric forest, and kept winding down into the valley for what felt like an hour. The fog made our visibility almost null, the lack of other people was weighing on me and for the first time in the trip I though "I can't do this." Panic started to set in, the darkness was suffocating and isolation felt heavy. We pulled up to our campsite and the tears started to flow as we pitched our tent in the sopping moss and mud. The next morning, on my 28th birthday, I emerged from the tent into a remaining slice of old growth forest. All of the fear was abandoned and replaced with swelling amazement that somewhere like this still exists on this earth. I spent the first day of my 28th trip around the sun surrounded by slow giants, who made me feel microscopic and full of wonder. </p>

                    <p>After spending a few days in the Redwoods, I was definitely not ready to go back to a city. When I was planning the trip I was thinking that after being in a tent for nearly three weeks I would want some semblance of 'normal' life but I think sleeping outdoors had become normal at that point. We crossed the Golden Gate Bridge while listening to The Dark Side of the Moon (Austin had never heard it) and rolled into the chaotic cityscape to Money by Pink Floyd. The grade of the streets was jarring and seemed impossible, I felt like there was no way my car was going to put up with the 31% grade the city offered. After white knuckling through the city we decided to ditch the car at our Air BnB and rely on public transportation to get around. We took the train from Oakland to SF, and spent easily my least favorite day walking around the city. After shuffling around (perhaps all the wrong parts) for a day we were ready to embark on the last leg of our trip, Yosemite. </p>

                    <p>Rolling into Yosemite was different than any of the other park we had been to. Yosemite feels like its own functioning city in a way, nestled within the glacial valley are grocery stores, pizza joints, museums, and even a Starbucks. Even with these conveniences so close, Yosemite still feels massive and wild in a way that nothing manmade could touch. The hulking rock formations surround Yosemite Valley, jutting up in an array of shapes that make the valley floor feel swaddled in stone. Our first night there, a prodigious tree fell on the outskirts of camp. The tree fell with such force that the ground shook and the crack of the wood rang out like thunder from a lightning strike yards away. We walked past the aftermath of the fall on our way to Half Dome the next day, the trunks diameter was at least three times as tall as I was. On the second to last day of our trip, we accomplished the greatest feat I have ever undertaken. We set off from camp at 6:30 am, and by noon we were standing on the summit of Half Dome. We climbed a total of 4,000 feet in the span of 8 miles,  and then another 400 feet up the steep face of the Half Dome using two metal lines known as 'the cables'. Climbing Half Dome was easily the most difficult physical accomplishment I've ever completed in my life, but also the hardest mental task I have overcome. Starting at the base of the cables I was physically shaking with fear and doubt started to creep in. Despite every cell in my body telling me to turn back, I persevered one step at a time up the east face of the dome. Once we reached the top, a flood of accomplishment, pride, and euphoria washed over me like a wave and gratitude for the ability of my physical body filled me up from the inside. 10.5 hours after we left camp that morning, we came trudging back more sore, achy and proud than I have ever been in my life. It was honestly the perfect cap to our 28 day journey.</p>
